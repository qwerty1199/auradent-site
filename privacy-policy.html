      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <section>
      <p>This Privacy Policy explains how AuraDent («we», «us», «our») collects, uses, and discloses personal information when you visit or use our website and services. We aim to be clear, minimal, and practical — this page covers the basics for a small dental clinic website.</p>
    </section>

    <h2>1. Information we collect</h2>
    <p>We collect only the information you voluntarily provide, for example when you:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Submit a contact or appointment request (name, email, phone, message, preferred date).</li>
      <li>Subscribe to our newsletter (email address).</li>
      <li>Interact with third-party widgets that display on our site (for example, review widgets).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How we use your information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>To respond to appointment and contact requests.</li>
      <li>To send newsletters and important updates (only if you subscribe).</li>
      <li>To improve our website and services and to detect fraud or abuse.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Cookies and tracking</h2>
    <p>We use cookies and standard web technologies (such as local storage and analytics) to store preferences and gather anonymous usage information. Cookies are used to make the site work and to improve user experience. You can disable cookies in your browser — some features may not work as expected if you do.</p>

    <h2>4. Third-party services</h2>
    <p>We may embed or load content from trusted third parties (for example Google Maps, review widgets). Those services may collect information and are governed by their own privacy policies. We do not control the data collection of those third parties; please review their policies if you interact with them.</p>

    <h2>5. Data sharing and disclosure</h2>
    <p>We do not sell personal data. We may share information with service providers who help deliver our services (for example, email providers). We may also disclose information if required by law or to protect our rights.</p>

    <h2>6. Data retention</h2>
    <p>We retain personal information only as long as necessary to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected and to comply with legal obligations. If you request deletion, we will remove your data from active systems where possible.</p>

    <h2>7. Security</h2>
    <p>We take reasonable measures to protect your information from unauthorized access. However, no internet transmission is fully secure — please be mindful when sharing very sensitive information through contact forms.</p>

    <h2>8. Your rights</h2>
    <p>Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights to access, correct, or delete your personal information. To exercise those rights, please contact us using the details below.</p>

    <h2>11. International transfers</h2>
